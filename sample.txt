# Launching something new

Hey everyone — I’m excited to share a tiny tool I built:

**MD → LinkedIn Unicode Formatter**

It lets you write in Markdown and paste into LinkedIn with:

- *italic* emphasis
- **bold** highlights
- ***bold + italic*** for extra punch
- `monospace` for commands (e.g. `npm run build`)
- ~~strikethrough~~ for quick edits

## Why this exists

Writing posts is easier in Markdown, but LinkedIn doesn’t support formatting like GitHub does.
So this uses the “Unicode trick” (mathematical letter variants) to *look* formatted.

## Try it

1. Open the page (`index.html`)
2. Paste this text into the left textarea
3. Copy the output on the right and paste into LinkedIn

P.S. If you spot edge cases (nested emphasis, weird underscores), tell me — I’ll improve it.
